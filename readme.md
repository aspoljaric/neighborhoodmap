Neighbourhood Map

Description
-----------
This is a web site which allows users to navigate to some of the favourite places I like to eat.
It uses Google Maps to display the map information and Yelp to gather more information about the location, such as rating, phone number etc.

The design implements a responsive UI to work well on multiple devices.

Installation
------------
Run the index.html file

The implementation of OAuth for Yelp was referenced here;
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13149211/yelp-api-google-app-script-oauth

It is not the recommended way of doing this as JavaScript is all client side. If the application was being hosted on a server with server side code then OAuth for Yelp would be fine and safe to do.
